This project provides a simple example of using `encodec` in stereo mode with `torchaudio`.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -U torchaudio encodec transformers

# Encodec Stereo Example

This project provides a simple example of using `encodec` in stereo mode with `torchaudio`.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install torchaudio
Usage
Download a stereo audio file (e.g., a WAV file with two channels) that you want to use with encodec.

Use torchaudio to load the audio file in stereo mode:

python
Copy code
import torchaudio

audio_file_path = "path/to/your_audio_file_stereo.wav"
waveform, sample_rate = torchaudio.load(audio_file_path, num_channels=2)
Install and use encodec to encode the audio signal:

python
Copy code
from transformers import EncodecModel, AutoProcessor, EncodecConfig

# Load the encodec model
configuration = EncodecConfig(audio_channels=2)
model = EncodecModel(configuration)

# Encode the audio signal
inputs = processor(waveform, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Access the embeddings
audio_codes = outputs.audio_codes
audio_values = outputs.audio_values
Explore and use the generated embeddings based on your specific needs.

Tips and Notes
Ensure that your audio file is in stereo format (two channels).
Refer to the documentation of torchaudio and encodec for more information on available options and parameters.
